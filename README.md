## üå≤ Branching

We use [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) to accommodate short-lived branches and a _**"trunk"**_ _(our `master` branch)_ as a source of truth.

- **Feature: `feature/*`**

  Example: `feature/JIRA-123-my-new-feature`

- **Bug: `bugfix/*`**

  Example: `bugfix/JIRA-123-fix-an-issue`

- **Release: `release/*`**

  Example: `release/JIRA-123-brand-new-product`

## üèÜ Making Commits

We format our commit messages using [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). This provides the project a consistent, easy structure that allows for automation opportunities.

- It is **important** that you use Commitizen when making commits

- In your **terminal** run `yarn commit` when making a commit to enter the interactive GUI.

## üíæ Pull Requests

This project has a template that sets the pull request structure that we expect from contributors.

- It is **important** to _**give**_ as much context to _**get**_ the best review from your peers.

  _(write the pull request that you would love to encounter yourself)_

- You do not have to fill out each section if it is not applicable.

## üóúÔ∏è Merging

We always _**Squash**_ our _Pull Requests_. This makes a `cherry-pick` from `master` to a `release/*` branch when addressing a Bug Fix easy.

Make sure to _**ALWAYS**_ rebase _(not merge)_ `master` into your local branch when developing. We strive for a flat Git commit history when possible.
